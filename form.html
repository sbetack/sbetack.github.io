<p>For more information about traveling to Crotia click <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia">here!</a></p>
<p>This website is very aesthetically pleasing. I think that the "travel crotia by interest" section should be move higher up in the webpage so that it is above the recent articles section. I also think they could present more information at once if they made fonts smaller and put things side-by-side. This way the user would not have to scroll as much.</p>
